                <p class="paragraph">There was once a pretty little girl called Piña, who was loved dearly by her mother to the point of spoiling her. As Piña grew older, she had become lazy, inconsiderate and self-centered. Yet the mother didn't mind her daughter's behavior, because she wanted Piña to depend on her forever.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">One day, the mother fell ill and could not bring herself to cook food for Piña, while the young girl kept complaining that she was hungry. This time, Piña's mother had to stay firm for the  young girl's sake. On the other hand, Piña forced herself to go to the kitchen, grumbling and resentful that her mother was sick. The girl half-heartedly set out to cook "lugaw" or rice porridge the way her mother instructed her.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">While in the kitchen, Piña kept asking where her mother kept the things she needed.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">"Mother, where is the rice keeper?" The mother had to shout her answer several times over because Piña took ages before she could find whatever it was she was looking for.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">"Mother, where are the woods for the stove?"</p>
                <p class="paragraph">"Mother, where's the soup ladle?"</p>
                <p class="paragraph">"Mother, where's the salt?"</p>
                <p class="paragraph">"Mother where's the bowl?"</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Note that to all of Piña's questions, the sick mother had to shout at the top of her lungs, which only made her feel worse. Feeling weak and exasperated with Piña's unending questions, the mother finally lost her temper and let out a curse: "Heaven forbid child! But I call on all the gods to put eyes all over your face so you can see the things you're looking for." Tired and weak Piña's mother fell asleep.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">When the mother woke up, the house was dark and quiet. She called Piña but there was no answer. The mother willed herself to investigate where Piña could be, but the mother only found the unfinished cooking task. The mother was saddened by the thought that Piña decided to leave her, because she was sick and could no longer take care of her daughter.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">As she was about to leave the kitchen, she tripped on something that was lying on the floor, all the while thinking that it was one of Piña's many things. She picked up the strange looking object, which was shaped like a human head with tufts of leaves atop its crown.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The mother had an uncanny feeling that the brown circles scattered all over the object reminded her of Piña's beautiful brown eyes. Horrified, the mother remembered that she let out a terrible curse on her daughter before she fell asleep – in fact, she called on all the gods to put eyes all over Piña's face. Thus, the strange looking fruit was called "pinya" or pineapple, since Piña simply vanished into thin air.</p>
